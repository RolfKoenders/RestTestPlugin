# RestTestPlugin
> A proof of concept

The idea what im testing / playing with is to have a minecraft plugin that exposes an http rest interface for communication. That way we could 'in a secure way' communicate with a minecraft servers data without having to connect to its databases directly.

### Dependencies
Currently using https://undertow.io to create an simple http server.
